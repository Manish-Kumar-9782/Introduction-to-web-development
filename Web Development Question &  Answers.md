# Web Development Question and Answers

### 1. What is CSS?

`>> CSS:` Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

### 3. What are the advantages of CSS?

- `CSS saves time:` You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
- `Easy Maintenance:` To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
- `Search Engines:` CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
- `Superior styles to HTML:` CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
- `Offline Browsing:` CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.

### 4. What is Embedded Style Sheet?

`Embedded Stylesheet:` It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the `<style></style>` tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied across multiple documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded style sheets. Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you to address one HTML element at a time.

`Syntax:` The CSS syntax for embedded style sheets is exactly the same as other CSS code, apart from the fact that it is now wrapped within the `<style></style>` tags. The `<style>` tag takes the ‘type’ attribute that defines the type of style sheet being used (ie. text/CSS).

### 8. What do you mean by `<p>` tag?

The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing `</p>` tag. See "Tag omission" below.
