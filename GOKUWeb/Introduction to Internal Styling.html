<!--

	1. Internal style: internal is used when we want to apply the a single or multiple styles on multiple
		elements, without using the external style sheet.
		
	first we need to selecte an element to apply the style:
	
		parent child: -> left most element must pe parent for the right element.
		
		
		we can selecte an element by:
		
		1. tagName: if tagName selected then the defined property will be applied on the all the tag with that name.
		2. id: since id is unique, style will be applied only on that perticular element.
		3. class: since class can be shared, hence property will be shared, with all the elements who share the that perticular 
			same class.
