<!-- 
    In this section we will use the css float property, in which we will learn how to use this property

    float: it has left and right;

    if left: it will be placed left of the viewport and the current parent container.
    if right: it will be placed right of the viewport and the current parent container.

    Note: to clear the effect of the float we need to use the clear property.
    clear: left, right, both;

        <p>The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation
            of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence. The
            explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as
            evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph.

            Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until
            all points/examples that the writer deems necessary have been made
            and explained. NONE of your examples should be left unexplained.
            You might be able to explain the relationship between the example
            and the topic sentence in the same sentence which introduced the
            example. More often, however, you will need to explain that
            relationship in a separate sentence.
