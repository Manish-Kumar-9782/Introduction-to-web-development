		<div>this is div container.</div>
		
		<!--Note: since div element is used to contains the other element, so 
			should not use the direct text content inside the div element.-->
			
		
		<p>In this section we will learn how to add images, animations, audio and 
		video to our web page or site. image, audio and video are the other type 
		of content which allow us to share the data in the visual and audible 
		form. In all them images are used to increase the visual effect of our 
		web page or site.</p>
		
		
		<div>
	
			<p>we put an image on the web page by using the img which has no closing tag. Images can be in different format, generally we use three kind of image format to put them on the web page. these are (JPEG, GIF, PNG) </p>
			
			<p> Images are added to a site by using the img elmement, which has to carry at least tow attributes: the src attribute, indicate the source of the image, and an alt attribute, which provide a description of the imag</p>
			
			<p>We should always maintain our image at our server and should avoid the using the images from different site. images form different sites may delete or moved from one location to another, in this case we will be able to display the imgae on our page. In best practice we should always store the image on the our server side and use them instead of external image. </p>
