                    grid-template-column: nfr

                    we can also use the fraction system to organize the our section to display them in more appropriate way 
                    in this 'n' show the amount of fraction of the page and 'fr' shows the short form of the fraction: .;

                    example :- 
                            grid-template-column: 1fr 2fr 3fr;

                    in this example we can also add a function called repeat()

                    example :-
                            grid-template-column:repeat(x, y);

                            x - it show the how many times you want to repeat the fraction which is defined in y

                            y - it the defination for the fraction of the page

                            example: y can be write as  combination of fraction like '1fr 2fr 3fr' this fraction will applied by x time: .;
                            
                            Now suppose that x=2 and y = 1fr 2fr 3fr, then the it will be shown as ' 1fr 2fr 3fr 1fr 2fr 3fr'
