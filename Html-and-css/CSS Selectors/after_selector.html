        <!-- we will apply all the css style internally so we will use style
        tag -->
        <style>
            /* Now here we will define the style using ::after selector.  */

            /* Now suppose that we want to insert some tag after every p element
            and highligh it using style for that we need to use the ::after on p
            element. */

            p::after {
                /* Now this property will apply after every p element. */
                content: "<|--end--|>";

                /* Now we want to apply some style on the after content. */
