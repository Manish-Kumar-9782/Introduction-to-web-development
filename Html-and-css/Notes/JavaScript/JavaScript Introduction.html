            <h1>JavaScript Introduction</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages.
                in Web pages. in web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>ECMAScript provides the core functionality</li>
                <li>The <i class="hlight">Document Object Model</i> (DOM) provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages.</li>
                <li>The <i class="hlight">Browser Object Model </i> (BOM) provides the browser API for interacting with the web browsers.</li>
            </ul>
        </header>

        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Basic functionality</h2>
            <p>JavaScript allows us to add interactivity to a web page. Typically, we use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enhance a 
                web page's functionality, such as <i class="hlight">validating forms</i>, creating interactive maps, and displaying animated charts.
            </p>

            <p>When a page is loaded, i.e. after HTML and css have been downloaded, the JavaScript engine in the web browser executes the JavaScript
                code. The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.
            </p>

            <p>The JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. in the beginning, JavaScript engines were implemented as interpreters.</p>

            <p>Note: modern JavaScript engines are Typically implemented as just-in-time compilers that compile JavaScript code to bytecode for improved performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript</h2>
            <p>When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is eecuted in web browsers. In this case, JavaScript works as client-side language.</p>
            <p>JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular JavaScript servers-side environment is <code class="mark">Node.js.</code>
            Unlike client-side JavaScript, server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows us to access database, file systems, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>JavaScript History</h3>
            <p>In 1995, JavaScript was created b a Netscape developer named Brendan Eich. First, its name was Mocha. And then, its name was changed to LiveScript.</p>
            <p>Netscape decided to change LiveScript to JavaScript to leverage Java's fame, which was popular. The decision was made just before Netscape released 
                its web browser product Netscape Navigator 2. As a result, JavaScript entered version 1.0.</p>
             
            <p>Netscape released Java 1.1 in Netscape Navigator 3. In the meantime, Microsoft indroduced a web browser product called the <i class="hlight">Internet Explorer 3</i> (IE 3) 
            which competed with Netscape. However, IE came with its own JavaScript implementation called JScript.</p>    

            <ul>
                <p>Now there were two different JavaScript version in the market.</p>
                <li>JavaScript in Netscape Navigator</li>
                <li>JScript in Internet Explorer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In 1997, JavaScript 1.1 was submitted to the <span class="hlight">European Computer Manufacturers Association </span> (ECMA) as proposal.
                <i class="hlight">Technical Committee #39</i> (TC39) was assigned to standardize the language to make it a general-purpose, cross-platefrom, and vendor-netural scripting language.
            </p>
            <p>TC39 came up with ECMA-262, a standard for defining a new scripting language named ECMAScript (often pronounced Ek-ma-script).</p>

            <p>After that, the <i class="hlight">International Organization for Standardization</i> and <i class="hlight">International Electrotechnical Commissions</i> (ISO/IEC) adopted <i class="mark">ECMAScript</i> (ISO/IEC-16262).</p>
