In this section we will learn about the css grid layout, how it works, how
it different with flex model etc.

CSS Grid Layout: The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system,
with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to 
use foates and positioning.

it is a two dimensional layout while flex model only works in one dimension.

A grid layout consists of parent element, with one or more child elements.


Grid Container: An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display 
property is set to grid or inline-grid.

    All direct children (1 level children/immediate) of the grid container 
    automatically become grid items.

A Grid Layout model contain row and columns.

Grid Columns: The vertical lines of grid items are called grid columns.
Grid rows: The Horizontal lines of grid items are called gird rows.

<!-- Now In this example we will make a grid layout model which will contain some 
row and columns with some elements. -->

<!-- Now we will make a our body of the documents. -->

                display: grid;

                /* Now we will put a background-color to the grid-container. */
                background-color: dodgerblue;

                /* Now we will give some padding to make a internal space b/w items
                and container border. */
                padding:10px;

                /* Now we will make three columns of the grid which will  contain

            }
