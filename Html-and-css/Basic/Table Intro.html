        <table>
            <!-- table is a block level element which can contain many other

            <!-- First of all we need to make a table header which will be a row.
            1. first we will make a table row.
            2. Inside the table row we will make the table header element.  -->

            <!-- Creating table row. -->
            <tr>
                <!-- creating table headings -->
                <th>Company</th>
                <th>Car Model</th>
                <th>Price</th>
            </tr>
            <!-- Now we have made a table heading/columns headings. -->

            <!-- Now we will make the other table row in which we will add the

            <!-- Creating the table row for table data -->
            <tr>
                <td>Hyundai</td>
                <td>Creta</td>
                <td>10.48 Lakh</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>

        <!-- Note: table data elements are the data containers of the table.
        They can contain all sorts HTML elements; text, images, lists, other,
    tables, etc.

    Table row: each table row starts with <tr> and ends with </tr>. 

    Note: We can make as many rows as we want in a table. we just need to make
    sure that the number of cells are in each row.

    Note: we can also have a row with less or more cells in a table but 
    we will see that in other table section.-->



    <!-- Table Headings: We use the <th> element to make table headings,
        By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but
            you can change that with CSS. -->

        </table>
