In this section we will learn how to make image map

Image maps allows us to add multiple links to the same image, with each 
link pointing to a different page. They are particularly helpful when 
thhe image needs to be divided up in irregular shapes (such as maps). 
Each of these clickable areas is known as a hotspot.

Image maps works is based on upon x and y coordinates, measured from the 
top left-hand corner of the image. These coordinate are used in two ways.

-> To specify where the hotspots are.
-> To work out where the user is clickng on the image.
-> By Comparing the coordinates of the hotspots with the coordinates where  
    the user clicks, the user can be sent to the link specified for that 
    hotspot.

There are actually tw types of image maps, both of which do the same job. 
The difference is how they work out, which hotspot you clicked on.

Client-side image maps: The web browser works out which part of the 
image the user has clicked on and takes the user to the appropriate page.

Server-side image maps: The browser sends the sever the coordinates, 
saying which part of the image the user clicked on, and these are 
processed by a script file on the server that determines which page 
the user should be sent to.

            usemap attribute to link the map with our image. -->

<!-- Note: here the pair of the coords should in x,y pairs 

    rect: it takes top-left and bottom-right corner coords.
    circle: it takes the center point coords and radius.
    polygon: it takes the x,y vlaues of each corner/vertex of the polygon.
