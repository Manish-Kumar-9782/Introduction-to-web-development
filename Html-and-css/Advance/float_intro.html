In this section we will see learn about the CSS float property:

float: The float property specifes whether an element should float to the
left, right, ornot at all.

Note: Absolute Positioned elements ignore the float property.

Note: Element next ot the floating element will flow around it. To avoid this,
use the clear property or the clearfix hack

float values: none, left, right, initial, inherit.

        <div>
            <p> <span>Sunset</span> is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar 
                winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting,
                like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly 
                to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its
                place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, 
                entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. 
                There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>In the above paragraph first word Sunset is embedded in the
                span element. The span element has a width that is 3.7 times 
                the size of the current font. The font-size of the span element
                is 400% (quite large) and the line-height is 80%. The font of the 
                letter is the span will be in "Algerian".
