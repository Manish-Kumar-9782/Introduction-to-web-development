In this section we will learn about overflow property, what it is used for?
how to use it?

overflow: The overflow property controls what happens to content that is too
big to fit into an area.

CSS Overflow: The overflow property spcifies whether to clip the content or to add
scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit the specified area.

overflow property values:
    -> visible: default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outsides
        the element's box.

    -> hidden: The overflow is clipped, and rest of the content will be invisible.

    -> scroll: The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest
        of the content.

    -> auto: Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary.

    Note:-> The overflow property only works for block elements with a 
        specified height or width.

    Note:-> In OS X Lion (on mac), scrollbar are hidden by default and only ahown
    when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).
