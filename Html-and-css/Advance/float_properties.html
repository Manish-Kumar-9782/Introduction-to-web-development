In this section we will learn the float and clear property together, we will
learn that what are float and clear properties about? 

float: The css <<float>> property specifies how an element should float.

clear: The css <<clear>> property specifies what elements can float beside the
    cleared element and on which side.


Application and Property:

    * The float property is used for positioning and formatting content, for 
        example let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

    * left - The element floats to the left of its container.
    * right - The element floats to the right of its container.
    * none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it
    occurs in the text). This is default.
    * inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent.
    
Example: In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text 
    around images.
