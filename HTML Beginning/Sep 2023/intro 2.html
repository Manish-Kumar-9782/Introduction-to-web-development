		<h2>Rahul Gandhi's return to Parliament challengedin 
		Supreme Court</h2>
		
		
		<p>
		Apetition was filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday against the restoration of Congress 
		leader Rahul Gandhi's Lok Sabha membership. <br>

		Rahul Gandhi was reinstated as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Wayanad, Kerala on August 7. 
		He had been disqualified as a Lok Sabha MP on March 23 after a Gujarat court convicted him 
		in a defamation case. <br>

		The petitioner, advocate Ashok Pandey, argued that once a member of Parliament or an Assembly 
		loses his office due to legal proceedings, he should remain disqualified until acquitted of the 
		charges by a higher court. <br>

		The petition said that in Gandhi's case, only the punishment had been stayed, not the conviction 
		itself.<br>
