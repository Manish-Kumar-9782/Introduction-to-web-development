		<dt>Jaipur</dt>
		<dd>Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once ruled the 
		region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark 
		building color. At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, 
		colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal 
		residence. </dd>
		
		<dt>Ajmer</dt>
		<dd>Ajmer is a city in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan. South of the city's artificial Ana Sagar Lake 
		is Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the domed shrine of the Muslim Sufi saint Garib Nawaz. Nearby, a 16th-century palace 
		built by the Mughal emperor Akbar now houses the Ajmer Government Museum, displaying armor and stone sculptures. 
		A museum at the Indo-Saracenic–style Mayo College exhibits art and taxidermied birds.</dd>
		
		<dt>Jodhpur</dt>
		<dd>Jodhpur is a city in the Thar Desert of the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Its 15th-century Mehrangarh 
		Fort is a former palace that’s now a museum, displaying weapons, paintings and elaborate royal palanquins (
		sedan chairs). Set on on a rocky outcrop, the fort overlooks the walled city, where many buildings are painted 
		the city’s iconic shade of blue.</dd>
