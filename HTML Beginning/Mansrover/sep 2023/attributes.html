		<h2>Sonia Gandhi's Letter To PM Sparks Controversy: After BJP's 'Unaware <br>
		Of Traditions' Barb, Congress Hits Back</h2>
		

		<p dir="rtl"> New Delhi: Ever since the Centre announced a special session of Parliament which 
			is scheduled to begin on September 18, the Opposition and the BJP have been sparring
			over the issue. Earlier in the day, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi wrote to 
			Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the agenda of the proposed special 
			Parliament session.</p>
		
		<p> Highlighting the absence of a declared agenda for the upcoming special 
			parliament session commencing on September 18, she presented a list of 
			nine topics, urging discussions on them. The subjects encompassed matters 
			such as Center-state relations, communalism, the situation in Manipur, and 
			the border dispute with China.</p>
		
		<p> "You have convened a special five-day session of the Parliament beginning 
			18 September 2023. I must point out that this Special Session has been 
			convened without any consultation with other political parties. None of 
			us have any idea of its agenda," the Congress leader said.</p>
		
		<p> 	A few hours later Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi responded 
			to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's letter to PM Modi, accusing the Congress
			MP of politicising the functioning of Parliament.</p>
		
		<p> 	"The session has been called following tradition. Perhaps you are not 
			paying attention to tradition. Before calling the Parliament session, 
			there is never any discussion with political parties, nor are the issues 
			discussed. After the calling of the session by the President and before 
			commencement of the session, there is a meeting of the leaders of all the
			parties in which the people rising in the Parliament are discussed. 
			Issues and work are discussed." the minister wrote.</p>
