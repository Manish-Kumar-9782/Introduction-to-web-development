        <dt dir="rtl">Jaipur City</dt>
        <dd dir="rtl">Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family
            that once
            ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink
            City” for its trademark building color. At the center of its stately street grid
            (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens,
            courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence</dd>

        <dt>Ajmer City</dt>
        <dd>Ajmer is a city in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan. South of the city's
            artificial Ana Sagar Lake is Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the domed shrine of the Muslim Sufi
            saint Garib Nawaz. Nearby, a 16th-century palace built by the Mughal emperor Akbar now
            houses the Ajmer Government Museum, displaying armor and stone sculptures. A museum at
            the Indo-Saracenic–style Mayo College exhibits art and taxidermied birds.</dd>

        <dt>Jodhpur City</dt>
        <dd>Jodhpur is a city in the Thar Desert of the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Its
            15th-century Mehrangarh Fort is a former palace that’s now a museum, displaying weapons,
            paintings and elaborate royal palanquins (sedan chairs). Set on on a rocky outcrop, the
            fort overlooks the walled city, where many buildings are painted the city’s iconic shade
            of blue. </dd>
