			<h2>AB de Villiers Names Indian Pacer Among</h2>
			<p>South African batting legend AB de Villiers, regarded as one of the greatest batters to have played the sport, named an Indian pacer among the three toughest bowlers he faced in his cricketing career. De Villiers, a finisher par excellence, had an illustrious career with Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore. The right-hander scored 5030 runs in 181 IPL matches with a personal best score of 133, laced up with 3 centuries and 38 half-centuries -- reason why he is regarded as one the greatest foreign players to have ever played in world's richest T20 tournament.</p>
