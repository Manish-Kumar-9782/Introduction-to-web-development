        The <i>number</i> of <em>income</em> tax returns (ITRs) filed for FY2023 has <b>surpassed
            6.81
            crore</b>. The
        number is <strong>expected to cross 7.8</strong> crore in the remaining days of the
        financial year till March
        2024.

        “For AY24, 68 million ITRs have been filed by the due date and another 18-20 million returns
        are expected to be filed in the remaining financial year till March 2024, thereby taking the
        total number close to/over <big>85</big> million / <small>~37%</small> of formalized labor
        force,” a report from SBI
        revealed.

        For <del>AY24</del> <ins>AY25</ins>, the report<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> believes the
        share of IT
        returns filed after
        due date may drop to
        around <sub>20</sub> per cent. “This reveals the discipline among tax-payers along with the
        <bdo dir="rtl">simplification</bdo> of IT forms and processes driven by constant efforts of
        CBDT to build an
        efficient, digital-heavy filing, verification, and return architecture sans hassles,” added
        the report.
