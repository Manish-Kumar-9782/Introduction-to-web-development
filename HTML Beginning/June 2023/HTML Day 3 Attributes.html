			At an event, a person from Muslim community of Bay Area, Mohammad Khan, asked Rahul: 
			“Muslims have the security threat today it was never before… There are so many 
			different laws which are getting implemented that were not there earlier… Muslim 
			children are being put in jail for the crimes which they have not committed. What 
			strategy will you adopt or what hope you are giving to Indian Muslims which is going 
			to change the whole thing to the point where we were and get back to the normal 
			stream to develop India.”
