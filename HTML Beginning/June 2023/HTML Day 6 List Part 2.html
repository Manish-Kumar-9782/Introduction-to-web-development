    <dl>
        <dt>Jaipur</dt>
        <dd>Jaipur is the capital of India's Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once
            ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink
            City” for its trademark building color. At the center of its stately street grid
            (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens,
            courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence. </dd>

        <dt>Ajmer</dt>
        <dd>Ajmer was originally known as Ajayameru. The city was founded by an 11th-century
            Chahamana king Ajaydeva. Historian Dasharatha Sharma notes that the earliest mention of
            the city's name occurs in Palha's Pattavali, which was copied in 1113 CE (1170 VS) at
            Dhara. This suggests that Ajmer was founded sometime before 1113 CE.[8] A prashasti
            (eulogistic inscription), issued by Vigraharaja IV and found at Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra
            (Sanskrit college), states Ajayadeva (that is Ajayaraja II) moved his residence to
            Ajmer.[4]</dd>

        <dt>Jodhpur</dt>
        <dd>Jodhpur is the second-largest city in the Indian state of Rajasthan and officially the
            second metropolitan city of the state. It was formerly the seat of the princely state of
            Jodhpur State. Jodhpur was historically the capital of the Kingdom of Marwar, which is
            now part of Rajasthan. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination, featuring many palaces,
            forts, and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert. It is popularly known
            as the "Blue City" among people of Rajasthan and all over India. </dd>
