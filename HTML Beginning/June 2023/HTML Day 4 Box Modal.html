			<p>Have you walked out of a bank branch saddled with an insurance policy that you had 
			no plans of getting? Or have you been worried your account will be frozen if you missed 
			‘updating KYC’? The RBI has now come out with guidelines to improve customer service and 
			make banking hassle-free.</p>

			<h3 class="font-1">Meet the cricketer who scored first ODI century for India,</h3>
			<p>In today's era, it is not a big deal to score a century in international cricket and 
			most of the batsmen are successful in scoring more than one century in their career. But 
			hitting a ton was not easy in earlier times. India played its first ODI in 1974 against 
			England but India got its first ODI century after 9 years in 1983.</p>
