			<p> "Today he tried to kill me by suffocating me and he scares me and blackmails 
		me that he will kill me, cut me up in pieces and throw me away," Shraddha wrote 
		in the letter. "It's been 6 months he has been hitting me but I did not have the 
		guts to go to the police because he would threaten to kill me," Shraddha wrote 
		on November 23, 2020. The letter has reportedly been shared by Shraddha's 
		neighbour in Vasai with whom Shraddha had gone to file the complaint, an ANI 
		report said adding that Maharashtra Police confirmed the authenticity of the letter.</p>
