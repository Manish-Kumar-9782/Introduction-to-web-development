		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
		
		<p>Have you ever thought how the keys on the computer
			keyboard that are in human recognisable form are
			interpreted by the computer system? This section briefly
			discusses text interpretation by the computer.
			We have learnt in the previous chapter that
			computer understands only binary language of 0s and
			1s. Therefore, when a key on the keyboard is pressed, it
			is internally mapped to a unique code, which is further
			converted to binary.</p>
