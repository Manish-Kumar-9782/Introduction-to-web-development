		that has left them trapped inside their homes during the holiday season. Over 1.4 
		million homes and businesses are severely hit by the bomb cyclone as it has caused 
		blackouts, power outages and dropped temperatures. Most of the outages are in the 
		Eastern US where gusty winds have knocked down trees and power lines, reported the 
		Associated Press.</p>
