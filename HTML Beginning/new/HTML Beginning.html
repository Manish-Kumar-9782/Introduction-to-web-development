		<h2>Why Maharashtra wants to join states that have laws against ‘Love Jihad’</h2>
		<p>“Such cases are happening all across the country. Some states have made stringent
		laws to curb such cases; hence, Maharashtra is also ready to enact the law on similar 
		lines to ensure long-term protection to women,” Maharashtra Deputy Prime Minister 
		Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the law and judiciary portfolio, said on December 20. 
		The government will take a final call soon.

		Fadnavis also pointed out that in the recent past, there have been 40-odd morchas at 
		various places in the state demanding a ‘Love Jihad’ law.

		His comments came on a day rightwing activists beat up a youth who was accused of 
		love jihad in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh.<p>
