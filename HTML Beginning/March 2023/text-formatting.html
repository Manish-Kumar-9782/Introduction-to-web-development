        The Finance Minister has provided some relief to individual taxpayers by introducing a
        standard deduction of ₹50,000 and a deduction of up to ₹15,000 from family pensions under
        the new tax regime. This benefit was previously only available to salaried persons under the
        old tax regime. The Budget 2023 has also widened tax benefits for salaried individuals
        earning ₹15.5 lakh or more, who stand to gain ₹52,500. Every salaried taxpayer can seek a
        maximum deduction of up to ₹50,000 under Section 16(ia) of the Income Tax Act of 1961. This
        standard deduction is now available to taxpayers who receive pension income as well.
