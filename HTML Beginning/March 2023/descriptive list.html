        <dt>Jaipur</dt>
        <dd>Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once
            ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink
            City” for its trademark building color. At the center of its stately street grid
            (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens,
            courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence. </dd>

        <dt>Delhi</dt>
        <dd>Delhi, India’s capital territory, is a massive metropolitan area in the country’s north.
            In Old Delhi, a neighborhood dating to the 1600s, stands the imposing Mughal-era Red
            Fort, a symbol of India, and the sprawling Jama Masjid mosque, whose courtyard
            accommodates 25,000 people. Nearby is Chandni Chowk, a vibrant bazaar filled with food
            carts, sweets shops and spice stalls.</dd>
