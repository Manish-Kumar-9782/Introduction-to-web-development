<!-- 
        Now in this section we will see how to use internal styling.

        1. To define internal styling we need to make <style> element inside the <head> element.
        
        2. Now inside this as content we write the css rules (css styles.)

        3. first we select the element with any kind of selector, then we make a block {} in which we
            define the css properties in "PropertyName:value;" pairs.

        Basic Selector: As basic selector we use TagName, id and class to select any element.

            TagName: if we TagName selector, all the element associated with that TagName will be selected.
                if any kind of filter or advance selector is applied.

            id: if we use id to select element, it will select only a single element with that id, in each page 
                id must be unique.

            class: if we use class to select element, it can be applied on any kind of flow element, we can apply 
                this class on multiple element which can be different in types.
