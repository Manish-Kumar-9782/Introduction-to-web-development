		select-element {
			
			After selecting the element we need to make a block by using the curly bracket. {}
			
			Now inside this we each styling follow a pair of Style_name: Style_value separated by ':'
			Note: after each style we need to put semi-colon.
			
			Style1 : style_value;
			Style2 : style_value;
			Style3 : style_value;
